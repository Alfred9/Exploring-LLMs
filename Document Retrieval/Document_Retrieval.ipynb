            "The hyperkinetic syndrome is a symptom complex of hyperactivity, short attention span, distractibility, impulsivity, learning difficulties, other behaviour problems and 'equivocal' neurological signs. However, none of these terms has ever been objectively defined and at present diagnosis is largely a matter of clinical judgement. In the management of the disorder, drugs do have a place but the decision to use medication is a complex procedure diagnostically and therapeutically calling for the highest in clinical skill and medical supervision. The most useful medication at present is the stimulant group of drugs, particularly dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Antipsychotic drugs are sometimes useful but carry the risk of depressing higher CNS functions such as attention and cognition. Other drugs which have been shown to be of value include tricyclic antidepressants (although their effect is less predictable and less striking than that of the stimulants) and pemoline.\n",

            "Cases of otitis media in infants under 12 weeks of age were reviewed to delineate the frequency, clinical features, and etiologic agents involved. Tympanocentesis was performed in 42 infants, 0 to 5 weeks of age, and in 17, from 6 to 11 weeks of age. The most common symptoms were irritability/lethargy (69%), fever (52%), cough (36%), vomiting (21%), diarrhea (20%), tachypnea (20%), and anorexia (18%). Associated illnesses were present in 33 (54%) of the patients, the most common being pneumonia (9), bronchiolitis (7), meningitis (6), conjunctivitis (4), and omphalitis (4). No peripartum infections or severe perinatal problems were found. Common respiratory pathogens were the predominant etiologic organisms, but coliform organisms were identified in 18% of the infants under 6 weeks of age. Cultures were sterile or grew organisms of questionable pathogenicity (\"nonpathogens\") in 39% of specimens. Since the signs and symptoms of otitis media in children less than 12 weeks of age are nonspecific and frequently associated with other major illnesses, the physician caring for these infants needs to be more aware of this disease and the therapeutic problems it presents.\n",

            "Own data and analysis of previous publications show that situations where accidental ingestion of corrosive substances by children may have happened are frequent, but severe corrosive esophagitis leading to perforation or stricture formation is very rare. In case of suspected esophageal injury, esophagoscopy and glucocorticoid treatment become necessary. The evaluation of the initial symptoms in patients from our own material and from the literature indicates that all children with serious esophageal burns had one or more of the following symptoms: visible burns in the oral cavity, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, retrosternal or epigastric pain, cardiovascular collaps, airway stenosis. Hence, children with an uncertain history of ingestion and without any of these symptoms need not be treated. After ingestion of liquid substances, but never of dry or granular products, lesions in the esophagus without accompanying burns in the oral cavity were observed. The evaluation of 1158 cases of accidental ingestions of several types of household products and a collection of data from the literature on the causticity of these substances shows that cleaners containing mainly detergents and phosphates (with pH values generally between 9 and 11), and household bleaches on sodium hypochlorite basis, are relatively harmless. Drain cleaners (NaOH), decalcifiers (formic acid) and detergents for automatic dish washing machines (metasilicates) are very caustic and are responsible for the majority of serious accidents in children.\n",

Results indicated that emotionally disturbed boys required more space than normals; that subjects would approach closer than they would allow the object person to approach them; and that externals required more space than internals. There were no significant differences between high and low anxious subjects, nor between emotionally disturbed children diagnostically classified as overanxious reaction and those with other diagnosis. Finally, neither anxiety nor locus of control explained the significant normal-emotionally disturbed differences in space requirements. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed as well as the relationship between the present and previous research.\n",

            "The main aim of the present Conference has been to debate that early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy. The Conference was attended by specialists taking care of the child with cerebral palsy (C.P.): child neurologists, surgeons--orthopedists, psychologists, rehabilitants, pediatricians. In connection with the fact that the Conference was devoted to the early diagnosis and therapy of C.P., problems concerning the lower age groups of children were debated. The Conference discussed the definitions of \"cerebral palsy\" used in the literature, the clinical forms, the auxiliary diagnostic methods and their significance in the diagnosing of this pathological syndrome. Early clinical symptoms, enabling to establish the diagnosis of cerebral palsy were particularly extensively debated. In the latter problem particular attention was paid to the diagnostic value of kinetic automatisms of the group of tonic posture reflexes and dysfunctions of the kinetic pattern in children. It was underlined in the debate the C.P. was no separate clinical disease, but a pathological syndrome arisen as a result of the negative influence of different factors and yielding very diverse clinical and neurolopathologic symptoms, according to the kind of noxious factors and the period and degree of maturity of the nervous system in which they acted. The participants in the debate also sressed that, as the child develops and is observed for a longer period it is fairly often necessary to check this diagnosis, as C.P. may prove, as the time passes, to be a degenerative syndrome, a pressure syndrome etc. The psychologists participating in the Conference discussed the psychological problems of the child with C.P. and also the early diagnosis of the pathological syndrome debated. The diversity of the symptoms of the C.N.S. in children suffering from C.P. was underscored, as--apart from dysfunctions within the kinetic area, there can be present sight, hearing and speech dysfunctions, those of sensory perceptions and mental development. These children require multispecialist care, as everyone of dysfunctions mentioned may present a complicated diagnostic problem. Plenty of place was devoted to the discussion of problems connected with epilepsy in children with C.P. Also extensively debated were the general principles of the medical procedure in children with C.P. As a result of the discussion it was decided that children with severer forms of C.P. and those from poor social conditions should be subjected to long-lasting sanatorium rehabilitation. Keeping the child in its family environment should, however, be the generally adopted principle of the rehabilitation of a little child. The parents of the child should be trained in the proper rearing of the child under household conditions, a manner to secure all the needs resulting from the then stage of its development. In connection with this problem the project of the programme of sensoric-and-kinetic rehabilitation was debated, as presented by psychologists and rehabilitants (kinesitherapeuts).\n",

            "Investigated auditory word discrimination skill in children diagnosed as having minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), a heretofore unexplored topic in the study of MBD. A lack of auditory discrimination skill seems relevant to learning deficiency in language acquisition, a typical sign of MBD. The present study tested the hypothesis that phonemic aural discriminations would be difficult to make for boys diagnosed as having MBD. Errors and nonresponses made while Ss performed an extended auditory word discrimination task were compared between a group of 26 boys diagnosed as having MBD and a matched normal group. As expected, the MBD group had a significantly higher error rate than the normal group even when Ss were discriminating easy word pairs composed of dissimilar items (e.g., reading, math). These and other results suggested that the MBD group was very susceptible to fatigue even while motivated to perform well and while able to improve with practice. The relatively inferior performance of the MBD group was interpreted as resulting directly from a lack of auditory discrimination skill and indirectly from fatigue and its accompanying attention loss.\n",

            "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or, more correctly, juvenile chronic polyarthritis with its many clinical manifestations can be separated into the Still-syndrome with acute beginning, high fever and a high percentage of extra-articulalar, i.e. visceral symptoms, and the chronic polyarthritis in the more strict sense with non-visceral symptoms. The subsepsis allergica should be regarded as a subseptic first stage of the Still syndrome. The Still-syndrome implies a systemic disease mainly of the reticulo-endothelial system, with carditis, nephropathy, recurrent erythemas, and a progressing polyarthritis. Later symptoms are amyloidosis, chronic nephritis, myo- and pericarditis, and artheriitis necroticans. Predominanly the involvement of the kidneys is the reasons for the high mortality rate of 13%. Chronic polyarthritis in the strict sense is similar in children and adults, though in children rheumatic factors are rarely detected. The exsudative form of arthritis tends to cause early deterioration. Joint symptoms are distributed asymmetrically and show locally inflammed growth otherwise less common in Still-syndrome. Spondylitis cervicalis rapidly causes ankylosis. Atlanto-axial-arthritis with consequent atlanto-axial dislocation can be the reason for neurological disturbances. Juvenile mono- or oligo-arthritis often turns into polyarthritis; but for joints the prognosis is more favourable. In contrast, rheumatoid iridocyclitis as found in 22% of the cases causes unfavourable complications because symptoms are not noticed in time so that treatment is often too late. Juvenile spondylitis ankylosans begins with a peripheral arthritic stage which is not easily distinguished from chronic polyarthritis. The male sex, mono- or oligoarthritis of the outer extremities, pain in the heel, atlanto-axial-arthritis, iridocyclitis, and a positive HLA of 27 give a diagnostic clue. -- Characteristics of the therapy will be discussed.\n",

            "In 80 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonitis, the intial signs and symptoms of infection were usually fever and cough, followed by tachypnea and coryza. Flaring of the nasal alae and cyanosis occurred later. Blood gas composition was markedly altered in its acid-base profile in most patients at admission. There was moderate to severe respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia. Clinical manifestations were correlated with the extent of histopathologic changes in the lung. (Deprivation of protein in the diet of rats provoked P. carinii infection.) P. carinii infection was found in children with kwashiorkor; evidence of protein-calorie malnutrition is closely associated with P. carinii pneumonitis in children wiht cancer and other primary diseases. P. carinii pneumonitis proved unique in that the causative organisms remained limited to the lungs even in fatal cases. No toxins have been identified, and systemic effects of the infection were only those that could be related to hypoxia and fever.\n",

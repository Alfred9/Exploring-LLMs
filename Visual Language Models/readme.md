VLMs also know as Visual Language models.
In this notebook we  fine-tune SmolVLM VQAv2 dataset. With this notebook you can also fine-tune Idefics3, since both models have the same model class/architecture.

We will use some techniques in this notebook that will let you fine-tune the model on L4 with batch size of 4 only using around 16.4 GB of VRAM. We ran this notebook in that setup to test, but because we were able to afford A100 this notebook was last ran on an A100.

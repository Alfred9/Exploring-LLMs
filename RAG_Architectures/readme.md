RAG Architectures you should know

## 𝗡𝗮𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗥𝗔𝗚: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵
Naive RAG is the standard implementation with a relatively straightforward process:
• Query comes in from the user
• System retrieves relevant documents from a vector database
• Retrieved documents are combined with the query as context
• LLM generates a response based on both query and context
This works well for many simple applications, like basic Q&A systems or document assistants.

## 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝗥𝗔𝗚
This one adds a reranking step after the retrieval to improve response quality:
• Initial retrieval returns a larger set of potentially relevant documents
• A reranking model evaluates and scores these documents based on relevance
• Only the highest-scoring documents are sent to the LLM

## 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗔𝗚
The architecture leverages models that can process and retrieve from text, images, audio, video, and other data types. 

## 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 𝗥𝗔𝗚
Graph RAG uses a graph database to incorporate relationship information between documents:
• Documents/chunks are nodes in a graph
• Relationships between documents are edges
• Can follow relationship paths to find contextually relevant information

## 𝗛𝘆𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗱 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝗩𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗕 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 𝗗𝗕
This architecture combines both vector search and a graph database:
• Vector search identifies semantically similar content
• Graph database provides structured relationship data
• Queries can leverage both similarity and explicit relationships
• Results can include information discovered through relationship traversal

6️⃣ 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
A single agent makes decisions about retrieval:
• Analyzes the query to determine the best knowledge sources
• Makes strategic decisions about how to retrieve information
• Coordinates the retrieval process based on query understanding

7️⃣ 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗥𝗔𝗚
This one employs multiple specialized agents:
• Master agent coordinates the overall process
• Specialized retrieval agents focus on different tasks
• Agents can communicate and collaborate to solve complex problems
For example, one agent might retrieve from various sources, another might do data transformation, and a third personalizing the results from the user—all coordinated by a master agent that assembles the final response.
